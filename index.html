            <h3>What is Git?</h3>
            <p>
              Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus
              Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since
              then.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the main uses of Git are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tracking code changes</li>
              <li>Tracking who made changes</li>
              <li>Coding colaboration</li>
              <li>Backup system</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does Git do?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Manage projects with <b>Repositories</b></li>
              <li><b>Clone</b> a project to work on a local copy</li>
              <li>
                Control and track changes with <b>Staging</b> and
                <b>Commiting</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Pull</b> the latest version of the project to a local copy
              </li>
              <li><b>Push</b> local updates to the main project</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Git?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Over 70% of developers use Git!</li>
              <li>Developers can work together from anyther in the world</li>
              <li>Developers can see the full history of the project</li>
              <li>Developers can revert to earlier versions od a project</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Git is nor the same ad GitHub</li>
              <li>GitHub makes tools that use Git</li>
              <li>
                GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has
                been owned by Microsoft since 2018
              </li>
              <li>In this guide we will focus on using Git with GitHub</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="getting_started">
          <header>Getting Started</header>
          <article>
            <h3>Install</h3>
            <p>
              You can download Git for free from the following website:
              https://www.git-scm.com/
            </p>
            <h3>Using Git with Command Line</h3>
            <p>
              o start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command
              shell. For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in
              Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in
              terminal. The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is
              properly installed:
            </p>
            <code> git --version</code>
            <code class="code2">git version 2.30.2.windows.1</code>
            <p>
              If Git is installed, it should show something like git version
              x.x.x
            </p>
            <h3>Initial configuration</h3>
            <p>
              Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version
              control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
            </p>
            <code>git config --global user.name "YOUR USERNAME"</code>
            <code>git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"</code>
            <p class="note">
              Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every
              repository on your computer. If you want to set the
              username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global
            </p>
            <h3>Creating Git Folder</h3>
            <p>Now, let's create a new folder for our project:</p>
            <code>mkdir myProject</code>
            <code>cd myProject</code>
            <p class="note">
              mkdir makes a new directory. <br />
              cd changes the current working directory.
            </p>
            <h3>Initialize Git</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize
              Git on that folder:
            </p>
            <code>git init</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >Initialized empty Git repository in
              /Users/user/myproject/.git/</code
            >
            <p>You just created your first Git Repository!</p>
            <p class="note">
              Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated
              it on. Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
            </p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="adding_files">
          <header>Adding Files</header>
          <article>
            <h3>Adding New Files</h3>
            <p>
              You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty. So
              let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite
              text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you just created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once in the folder, you can use the following command to verify
              the status of the repository:
            </p>
            <code>git status</code>
            <code class="code2">
              <br />
              On branch master No commits yet <br />
              Untracked files: (use "git add ..." to include in what will be
              committed) <br />
              index.html (example file) <br />
              nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add"
              to track)
            </code>
            <p>
              Now Git is aware of the file, but has not added it to our
              repository!
            </p>
            <p>
              Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the
                repository
              </li>
              <li>
                Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not
                added to the repository
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all
              untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or
              add them to the staging environment.
              <br />
              We will cover the staging environment in the next chapter.

          <article>
            <h3>Staging</h3>
            <p>
              One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging
              Environment, and the Commit. As you are working, you may be
              adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a
              milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files
              to a Staging Environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the
              repository you are working on.
            </p>
            <p>
              For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to
              the Staging Environment:
            </p>
            <code>git add index.html</code>
            <p>The file should be Staged. Let's check the status:</p>
            <code>git status </code>
            <code class="code2">
              On branch master <br />
              No commits yet Changes to be committed: (use "git rm --cached ..."
              to unstage) <br />
              new file: index.html
            </code>
            <h3>Commiting</h3>
            <p>
              Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to
              commit for our repo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work.
              Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a
              point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want
              to make a change.
            </p>
            <p>When we commit, we should always include a message.</p>
            <p>
              By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself
              (and others) to see what has changed and when.
            </p>
            <code>git commit -m "First release of Hello World!"</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >[master (root-commit) 221ec6e] First release of Hello World!
              <br />
              3 files changed, 26 insertions(+) <br />
              create mode 100644 README.md <br />
              create mode 100644 bluestyle.css <br />
              create mode 100644 index.html</code
            >
            <p>
              The commit command performs a commit, and the -m "message" adds a
              message. The Staging Environment has been committed to our repo,
              with the message: "First release of Hello World!"

            <h3>Why use branches?</h3>
            <p>
              In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update the
              design on it.
            </p>
            <p>How would that work without and with Git:</p>
            <p>Whithout Git:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Make copies of all the relevant files to avoid impacting the
                live version
              </li>
              <li>
                Start working with the design and find that code depend on code
                in other files, that also need to be changed!
              </li>
              <li>
                Make copies of the dependant files as well. Making sure that
                every file dependency references the correct file name
              </li>
              <li>
                EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the
                project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
              </li>
              <li>
                Save all your files, making a note of the names of the copies
                you were working on
              </li>
              <li>Work on the unrelated error and update the code to fix it</li>
              <li>Go back to the design, and finish the work there</li>
              <li>
                Copy the code or rename the files, so the updated design is on
                the live version
              </li>
              <li>
                (2 weeks later, you realize that the unrelated error was not
                fixed in the new design version because you copied the files
                before the fix)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whith Git:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly
                without impacting the main branch
              </li>
              <li>
                EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the
                project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
              </li>
              <li>
                Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch
                with the main branch
              </li>
              <li>
                You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
              </li>
              <li>
                Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the
                small error fix that you were missing)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without
              impacting the main branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can even switch between branches and work on different
              projects without them interfering with each other.
            </p>
            <h3>New Git Branch</h3>
            <p>
              We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to
              disturb or possibly wreck the main project. So we create a new
              branch:
            </p>
            <code>git branch hello-world-images</code>
            <p class="note">
              Note: Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch,
              and move to it, if it does not exist
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we created a new branch called "hello-world-images" Let's
              confirm that we have created a new branch:
            </p>
            <code>git branch</code>
            <code class="code2">
              hello-world-images <br />
              * master</code
            >
            <p>
              We can see the new branch with the name "hello-world-images", but
              the * beside master specifies that we are currently on that
              branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from
              the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the
              command:
            </p>
            <code>git checkout hello-world-images</code>
            <code class="code2">Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'</code>
            <p>
              Now we have moved our current workspace from the master branch, to
              the new branch
            </p>
            <p>
              Open your favourite editor and make some changes. <br />For this
              example, we added an image (img_hello_world.jpg) to the working
              folder and a line of code in the index.html file
            </p>
            <p>
              We have made changes to a file and added a new file in the working
              directory (same directory as the main branch).
              <br />Now check the status of the current branch:
            </p>
            <code>git status</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >On branch hello-world-images <br />
              Changes not staged for commit: <br />(use "git add ..." to update
              what will be committed) <br />(use "git restore ..." to discard
              changes in working directory) <br />
              <br />
              modified: index.html <br />
              <br />
              Untracked files: <br />
              (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
              <br />
              img_hello_world.jpg <br />no changes added to commit (use "git
              add" and/or "git commit -a")
            </code>
            <p>So let's go through what happens here:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are changes to our index.html, but the file is not staged
                for commit
              </li>
              <li>img_hello_world.jpg is not tracked</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So we need to add both files to the Staging Environment for this
              branch:
            </p>
            <code>git add --all</code>
            <p>
              Using --all instead of individual filenames will Stage all changed
              (new, modified, and deleted) files.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are happy with our changes. So we will commit them to the
              branch:
            </p>
            <code>git commit -m "Added image to Hello World"</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >[hello-world-images 0312c55] Added image to Hello World <br />
              2 files changed, 1 insertion(+) create mode 100644 <br />
              img_hello_world.jpg</code
            >
            <p>
              Now we have a new branch, that is different from the master
              branch.
            </p>
            <h3>Git Branch Merge</h3>
            <p>
              We have the changes ready, and so let's merge the master and
              hello-world-images branches.
            </p>
            <p>First, we need to change to the master branch:</p>
            <code>git checkout master</code>
            <code class="code2">Switched to branch "master"</code>
            <p>
              Now we merge the current branch (master) with hello-world-images:
            </p>
            <code>git merge hello-world-images</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >Updating 09f4acd..dfa79db Fast-forward <br />
              index.html | 2 +- <br />
              1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</code
            >
            <p>
              Since the hello-world-images branch came directly from master, and
              no other changes had been made to master while we were working,
              Git sees this as a continuation of master. So it can
              "Fast-forward", just pointing both master and hello-world-images
              to the same commit.
            </p>
            <p>
              As master and hello-world-images are essentially the same now, we
              can delete hello-world-images, as it is no longer needed:
            </p>
            <code>git branch -d hello-world-images</code>
            <code class="code2"
              >Deleted branch hello-world-images (was dfa79db).</code
            >
